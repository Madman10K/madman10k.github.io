# Hey there
I am Stanislav, also known as Madman10K, I am 16 years old and mainly work on applications using C and C++

## About
I was born in the country of Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and the capital(also the biggest city), Sofia.

I started programming when I was 12 with the idea to start making games and other entertainment products using software. I started with Unity but found it very hard to use so after a month of using it, I switched to using [Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-18-released) with which I spent 2 years building games.

After making a couple of games that were never finished(but gaining a lot of experience on the way) I decided to take my Unreal Engine knowledge and make a game engine called the [UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine) on which I started working since I was 14 and am still working on! 
The goal of the engine was to replicate some of the features of Unreal Engine which I liked and to make a prototype game engine that can be potentially used by a real game development studio.

Now with 1 year and counting of developing the engine, I am working on both software around the engine and other software outside of it, a complete list of projects is provided below
## Projects
1. Forgotten game using Unity - January - February 2018
1. Multiple forgotten singleplayer games with various Unreal Engine versions - April 2018 to August 2019

with multiple more projects planned for later. All of them are created under [MadLad Squad](https://github.com/MadLadSquad) which is a github organization I and other users use to collaborate on all the software listed above.

## Work experience
I have done paid commissions since 2020 but they have mostly been rare(i.e. once every 3-4 months) and private, so no details can be discussed here. What I can say is that I worked on various C++ projects with my job being:
1. Fixing bugs
1. Refactoring, modernizing and cleaning up a codebase
1. Porting a codebase from Windows to Unix or vice versa
1. Other various programing work including writing small features for apps, implementing data structures and abstractions, and doing other general software development work

Outside of this, since I was in my period of game development January 2018 to December 2021, I also had the experience of managing a game project with other people. Specifically I worked on it with a team of 2 other people, an artist and a musician
## Programming knowledge
I have a lot of experience in C and C++ as they have been my main languages for over 3 years. I use both old and new C++ features in my projects and am accustomed to working with both new and legacy standard library C++

Outside of this I also know a bit of Golang, have written a good number of bash scripts, and made some websites with javascript

## Languages
I am a polyglot/multilingual(polyglot doesn't fit my language knowledge according to some definitions) and can speak 5 languages with various degrees of success.
1. Bulgarian 🇧🇬 - native
1. Macedonian 🇲🇰 - I can perfectly read, listen and understand the language like a native speaker but I make many gramatical mistakes during talking and writing due to it overlapping with my Bulgarian knowledge
1. English 🇬🇧 - between C1 and C2
1. German 🇩🇪 - almost A2
1. Mandarin Chinese(simplified) 🇨🇳 - HSK2

Additionaly I also understand certain parts of the following languages:
1. Serbo-Croatian 🇷🇸🇭🇷 - I can understand about 75-80% of it, but I cannot speak or write in it
1. Russian 🇷🇺 - I can understand from 40-80% of it depending on the text, and I still can't read or write in it
1. Japanese 🇯🇵 - I can read the 2 alphabets and know a limited number of kanji from my Chinese knowledge so I can guess some meaning from that, but I don't know any words or grammar so I can say that I don't know it
