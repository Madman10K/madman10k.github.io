Since 2018 I have developed and released over 50 FOSS projects, ranging from libraries, frameworks, game engines, development tools, CI/CD tooling and more. Of course, there are many more
projects that have not made it to their first release, with many being shelved. My current plan is to revive old projects, while aiming to create some new software as well.

I am also a student at the [Technical University in Sofia, Bulgaria](https://tu-sofia.bg), where I currently study Computer and Software Engineering for my bachelor's degree.
