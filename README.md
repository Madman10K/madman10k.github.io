# Hey there
I am Stanislav, also known as Madman10K, I am 16 years old and mainly work on applications using C and C++

## About
I was born in the country of Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and the capital(also the biggest city), Sofia.

I started programming when I was 12 with the idea to start making games and other entertainment products using software. I started with Unity but found it very hard to use so after a month of using it, I switched to using [Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-18-released) with which I spent 2 years building games.

After making a couple of games that were never finished(but gaining a lot of experience on the way) I decided to take my Unreal Engine knowledge and make a game engine called the [UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine) on which I started working since I was 14 and am still working on! 
The goal of the engine was to replicate some of the features of Unreal Engine which I liked and to make a prototype game engine that can be potentially used by a real game development studio.

Now with 1 year and counting of developing the engine, I am working on both software around the engine and other software outside of it, a complete list of projects is provided below

## Work experience
I have done paid commissions since 2020 but they have mostly been rare(i.e. once every 3-4 months) and private, so no details can be discussed here. What I can say is that I worked on various C++ projects with my job being:
1. Fixing bugs
1. Refactoring, modernizing and cleaning up a codebase
1. Porting a codebase from Windows to Unix or vice versa
1. Other various programing work including writing small features for apps, implementing data structures and abstractions, and doing other general software development work

Outside of this, since I was in my period of game development January 2018 to December 2021, I also had the experience of managing a game project with other people. Specifically I worked on it with a team of 2 other people, an artist and a musician

## Programming knowledge
I have a lot of experience in C and C++ as they have been my main languages for over 3 years. I use both old and new C++ features in my projects and am accustomed to working with both new and legacy standard library C++

Outside of this I also know a bit of Golang, have written a good number of bash scripts, and made some websites with javascript

## Languages
Here are the languages I am currently learning:
1. Bulgarian 🇧🇬 - native
1. English 🇬🇧 - between C1 and C2
1. German 🇩🇪 - A2
1. Mandarin Chinese(simplified) 🇨🇳 - HSK2

Additionally sometimes when I'm not learning Mandarin or German I learn the following languages:
1. Russian 🇷🇺
1. Macedonian 🇲🇰
1. Serbo-Croatian 🇷🇸🇭🇷
1. Japanese 🇯🇵
