A list of some uncomfortable political questions. Not sharing my personal opinions but simply questioning out of curiosity.

## Why do socialist governments support VAT or sales tax on essentials
Something illogical I have been coming to every time I think of socialist policy is the following: why do modern social democracies apply
sales tax or VAT on essential products, such as food, utilities, every-day products, hygene products, etc.

Since VAT or sales tax on these products is practically a regressive tax, why would so-called socialist governments still keep it. Removing
taxes, at least on the products that the majority uses in their life, should lower prices and therefore increase purchasing power for poorer
citizens.

> [!NOTE]
> VAT or sales tax on essentials is practically a regressive tax because there is not much of a difference between what rich and poor people
> consume as every-day products, therefore taxes on these products disproportionately affect poorer people, since they eat away more of
> their income.

## Why would a government prefer keeping gambling legal
In a society that strives to be fair enough for there to be upward mobility between economic classes, why would the government allow for
gambling enterprises to operate?

Gambling has the following negative effects:

1. It keeps poor people poor, destroys upward mobility and in severe cases, promotes downward mobility, specifically from the middle class.
1. It is inherently predatory and exploitative. If any other industry relied exclusively on deception to be profitable it would have been
   outlawed long ago.
1. The tax income is does not make up for the lost productivity and potential income taxes, specifically in countries with a
   progressive income tax system.

There is a possiblity that I am wrong in point 3, specifically in cases such as in Macao, where there casinos are used for widespread
money laundering. In the case of Macao, wealthy Chinese citizens from the mainland use casinos to go around the $50K currency export limit.

Still, how much money has to be laundered through casinos for the taxes on this money to be enough to justify sacrificing the prospect of
having a highly educated workforce  with well-paying jobs, who are going to collectively pay high income taxes regardless?

Also, there is the obvious problem of enforcement. Obviously, underground gambling operations will pop up, which is not the best for people
who partake in playing at such establishments. Sure, this is bad, but it will probably curb most gambling. 

Also, if a country was to allow for legal gambling, wouldn't it be better for the government to regulate the sector to put in
place harm reduction regulations, such as outlawing the use of dark patterns to keep customers playing for longer, capping play time,
making rigged games unprofitable, banning casino advertising, etc? From what I know, there's basically no government out there 
trying to implement harm reduction, which is also strange.

## Why do governments in larger countries treat tourism and hospitality as an essential industry
For a long time I have been having the following question: why would governments of mid-sized or even some large-sized countries try to
treat tourism and hospitality as an essential industry? I'm particularly asking this from the perspective of a Bulgarian citizen, who has
also been to Greece. Two countries that put a high priority on tourism when it comes to economic policy.

Sure, it's nice to have somewhere to go on holiday and it's nice to be able to go out with friends to a diverse assortment of restaurants
every weekend. However, if a country has the population, land and resources to facilitate more productive industries, why would such a
country prioritise tourism and hospitality.

Mass tourism puts immense strain on local infrastructure. Irresponsible visitors can cause damage to public property(looking at you Britons)
and can destroy nature by littering and damaging once-beautiful places. Places that become tourist hotspots overnight might also face
unintentional strain on their infrastructure when it was built to be used by a far smaller local population.

If the visitors are primarily wealthy it also causes inflation, a cost of living crisis for citizens of touristy areas. This can manifest
in restaurants and stores raising their prices, less housing affordability in neighborhoods where owners decide to offer properties on sites
like AirBNB or Booking.com instead of listing them for long-term renting or higher property taxes.

Mass tourism revenue is mainly undeclared and untaxed. Moreover, there are parasitic merchants such as the famous bracelet sellers in
places such as Rome or Paris, which are not only doing illegal business, but are also scammers. They are sometimes known to use violence
against the victims of their scams, when they refuse to purchase a bracelet. However, we should also consider that in many cases they
are migrants whose only work opportunity may be to sell bracelets.

Finally, workers in tourism work long hours for low pay. A quick look at Greece shows the dark reality of a country that mainly relies on
tourism and hospitality income. Greek workers log an average of 45.5 hours a week every year, while they are paid less competitive wages
than workers in other industries.
